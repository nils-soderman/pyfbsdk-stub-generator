# MotionBuilder pyfbsdk stubs

Project for generating fully typed python stub files for MotionBuilder's pyfbsdk modules

## What are stub files?

Stub files (`.pyi`) provide type information for Python modules, enabling better IDE support with autocompletion, type checking, and docstrings.

## Pre-generated stubs

Pre-generated stubs can either be manually downloaded from the [generated-stub-files](https://github.com/nils-soderman/pyfbsdk-stub-generator/tree/main/generated-stub-files) folder or through pip _(replace 2026 with your MotionBuilder version)_:
```bash
pip install motionbuilder-stubs==2026.*
```

To check available versions:
```bash
pip index versions motionbuilder-stubs
```

## Generating Stubs
For manually generating stubs, see the README.md in the [pyfbsdk-stub-generator](https://github.com/nils-soderman/pyfbsdk-stub-generator/tree/main/pyfbsdk-stub-generator) folder


## Issues

If you run into any issues with the generator or while using the generated stubs. Please [open a issue](https://github.com/nils-soderman/pyfbsdk-stub-generator/issues) on the GitHub repository.
